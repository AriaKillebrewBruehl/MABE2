# MABE
Version 2 of the Modular Agent-Based Evolver framework.

MABE is a software framework setup to easily build and customize software in
evolutionary computation or artificial life.  The resulting systems should be
useful for studying evolutionary dynamics, solving complex problems, or
exploring the open-ended power of evolution.

This new version is being re-built from scratch, using the Empirical library
with the goal of more modular control, flexible agents, and portability to
the web.
