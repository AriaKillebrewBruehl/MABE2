# Avida
Version 5 of the Avida Digital Evolution Software Platform.

Avida is a software platform for using digital evolution (a form of artificial life)
to study evolutionary dynamics.

This new version is being re-built from scratch, using Empirical and eventually MABE2.
For the moment, we are using this to draft out ideas from MABE2 as well.
