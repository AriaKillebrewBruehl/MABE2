Config as a whole should move from MABE to Empirical

We need a consistent and functional error system.
Right now we either output direct to the command line OR create a ConfigEntry_Error
with a meaningful error included, but it's then ignored and never printed.
What should happen is that an error message is raised and the appropriate interface
module handles it.

Events need to be made much more flexible.
Right now, all events are "timer" based, which means they are given a threshold for
when a particular signal variable reaches a certain value they start running and then
each time it makes it to the next threshold they run again until they pass the end
value.  Any of these variables can be disabled (so, for example, @start only runs
events once at the beginning), but each event type should be able to have its own
parameter types.
