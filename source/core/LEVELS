The eight core components of MABE are below.  Each component depends on all of those above it.

TraitInfo       - Information on how modules interact with trait (on organisms, populations, etc.)
ModuleBase      - Set of virtual function for interfacing with modules.
Organism        - Uses ModuleBase to track and interact with its OrganismManager
Population      - Contains a collection of Organisms and (some of which could be EmptyOrganisms)
MABE            - Main contoller object; manipulates Populations and Organisms
Module          - Modify main MABE contoller functions.
OrganismManager - Specialty Module to control specific types of organisms.
EmptyOrganism   - Specialty organism to represent an empty cell.
