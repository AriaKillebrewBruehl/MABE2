The eight core components of MABE are below.  Each component depends on all of those above it.

TraitInfo       - Specifications for module/trait interactions (on organisms, populations, etc.)
ModuleBase      - Core functionality for interfacing with all module types.
Organism        - Information about a single agent; ModuleBase is interface for OrganismManager
Population      - Collection of Organisms (some of which could be EmptyOrganisms)
MABE            - Main contoller object; manipulates Populations and Organisms
Module          - Modify main MABE contoller functions.
OrganismManager - Specialty Module type to manage organisms with shared configuration.
EmptyOrganism   - Specialty organism type to represent empty cells.
